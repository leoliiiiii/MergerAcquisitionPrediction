Predicting acquisition targets is a topic of great interest as it provides useful implications for buy-side M&A scenarios as well as for investors in the secondary market. Most previous papers about M&A prediction were limited to analysis on financial measures. This study aims to exploit textual data for predicting acquisitions through topic modeling on annual financial disclosures. The result demonstrates that models built upon carefully tailored topic features, together with financial measures, can achieve noticeable improvement in predictability over models incorporating only financial measures.
